## 📅 Year-by-Year Strategy Guide

### 🏗️ **EARLY SURVIVAL (1925-1930)**
*"Don't starve, don't collapse"*

#### Starting Situation
- **Resources**: 125 wood, 75 minerals, 100 food, 150 water, 250 land
- **Population**: 10 people (7 workers, 0 soldiers, 0 scientists)
- **Monthly Consumption**: 40+ food (4 per person) + 7% spoilage = ~47 food/month
- **Crisis Point**: You have ~2 months of food reserves

#### Month 1-6 Critical Actions
1. **Immediate Food Security**
   - Keep 6-7 people as workers (they generate food)
   - Workers produce: Food +3, Wood +2, Minerals +1, Water +2 each
   - **DO NOT** advance month without checking food levels

2. **Population Assignment Strategy**
   - Start: 7 workers, 0 soldiers, 0 scientists
   - Month 2-3: Switch to 6 workers, 1 scientist (when food is stable)
   - Scientists generate research points but don't produce food

3. **Technology Priority List**
   ```
   Priority 1: Agriculture techs (increase food production)
   Priority 2: Public Education (unlocks exponential scaling)
   Priority 3: Basic governance (stability bonuses)
   ```

4. **Monthly Checklist Before Advancing**
   - ✅ Food level > 50 units
   - ✅ No negative resource trends
   - ✅ Population mood > 50
   - ✅ Check for disaster warnings

#### Crisis Management (1925-1930)
- **Food Shortage**: Reassign soldiers/scientists back to workers immediately
- **Disaster Strikes**: Take emergency loans if needed (Banking System → Loans)
- **Population Unhappy**: Don't advance month until mood improves
- **Resource Depletion**: Workers are being consumed by industry - reduce industrial activity

#### Key Milestones to Achieve
- [ ] Stable food production (50+ monthly surplus)
- [ ] 1-2 scientists generating research points
- [ ] Public Education technology unlocked
- [ ] Population grown to 12-15 people
- [ ] Survived at least one random disaster

   - Resource chains = Steel → Electronics → Research loop
   - Financial systems = Debt leverage + investment returns
   ```

2. **Crisis Arbitrage**
   ```
   Disaster Opportunity Strategy:
   - Disasters create resource price volatility
   - Short positions on affected resources before/during crisis
   - Long positions on recovery resources afterward
   - Insurance systems (when available) for risk mitigation
   ```
