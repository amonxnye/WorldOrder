## Game Overview & Tutorial

### What is World Order?
World Order is a complex historical nation-building strategy game where players guide their nation from 1925 to 2050+. Unlike simple resource management games, World Order rewards deep strategic thinking through interconnected systems that create exponential scaling opportunities for smart players.

### Core Game Philosophy
- **Scarcity Creates Tension**: Limited resources force meaningful decisions from turn 1
- **Smart Allocation Rewards**: Education × Technology combinations unlock exponential growth
- **Risk/Reward Mastery**: Advanced financial systems offer massive gains for calculated risks
- **Consequence-Driven**: Every decision has lasting impacts on your nation's future

### Quick Start Tutorial

#### Phase 1: Survival (Years 1925-1930)
**Goal**: Don't starve, build basic infrastructure

1. **Start the Game**
   - Sign in and create your nation
   - You begin with severely limited resources: 125 wood, 75 minerals, 100 food, 150 water, 250 land
   - Population: 10 adults (5 men, 5 women) assigned as 7 workers

2. **Immediate Priorities**
   - **Food Crisis Management**: You consume 4 food per person per month + 7% spoilage
   - **Worker Assignment**: Navigate to Overview tab → Population Manager
   - Keep most people as workers (they generate food, wood, minerals, water)
   - Assign 1-2 people as scientists when you can afford it

3. **Monthly Survival**
   - Click "Advance Month" carefully - each month brings:
     - Food consumption (40+ units for 10 people)
     - Resource spoilage (7% food loss)
     - Random disasters (3% chance of major setbacks)
   - Monitor your food closely - starvation kills population

4. **Technology Investment**
   - Research tab → Focus on early agriculture and basic education techs
   - Public Education is crucial for exponential scaling later

#### Phase 2: Strategic Development (Years 1930-1945)
**Goal**: Build education foundation, unlock resource chains

1. **Education System Setup**
   - Get Public Education technology ASAP
   - Assign 2-3 scientists (they generate research points)
   - Scientists + Education = 2x research generation

2. **Resource Chain Mastery**
   - Iron Age technology → Steel production (Minerals + Workers → Steel)
   - Steel unlocks advanced construction and better military
   - Focus on resource interdependencies in Overview tab

3. **Economic Cycles**
   - Watch for economic boom/bust announcements
   - Boom periods: Great time for investments and expansion
   - Bust periods: Conserve resources, avoid debt

4. **Banking Strategy**
   - Overview tab → Banking System → Loans tab
   - Take small loans during emergencies only
   - Interest compounds monthly - debt spirals quickly

#### Phase 3: Exponential Scaling (Years 1945-1970)
**Goal**: Achieve exponential growth through smart combinations

1. **Education × Technology Synergies**
   - Higher Education + Industrial Revolution = Massive economy bonuses
   - Scientific Method + Higher Education = Culture and research explosions
   - Infrastructure techs provide compound bonuses (15% per additional tech)

2. **Advanced Resource Chains**
   - Oil discovery (post-1950) + extraction = Economy boosts
   - Electricity production (Coal + Water) = Enhanced production
   - Electronics (Steel + Electricity + Scientists) = Research point bonuses

3. **Research Breakthroughs**
   - With 3+ scientists + Higher Education: 1-5% monthly breakthrough chance
   - Breakthroughs provide massive bonuses (50% more food, +50 steel, etc.)
   - Accumulate research points to increase breakthrough probability

#### Phase 4: Master-Level Risk Management (Years 1970+)
**Goal**: Use advanced financial instruments for explosive growth

1. **High-Risk Investments**
   - Banking System → Investments tab
   - Extreme risk options: 50% chance of 10x return or total loss
   - Only invest what you can afford to lose completely

2. **Speculation Markets**
   - Banking System → Speculation tab
   - Trade resource futures with 2x leverage
   - Long positions bet prices go up, Short positions bet they go down
   - Oil and Steel have highest volatility = highest risk/reward

3. **National Debt Strategy**
   - Banking System → Take strategic debt for infrastructure
   - Debt provides immediate resources but compounds monthly at 5%+
   - >1000 debt triggers stability crisis, >2000 causes economic collapse

### Key Success Strategies

#### The Conservative Path
- Focus on steady resource generation
- Invest in education early and consistently
- Avoid debt and high-risk investments
- Reliable but slower growth

#### The Aggressive Path
- Take calculated risks with extreme investments
- Use debt strategically for rapid expansion
- Speculate on resource markets during volatile periods
- High risk, high reward - can lead to domination or collapse

#### The Master Path
- Build strong education/tech foundation first
- Use resource chain mastery for steady income
- Layer multiple risk systems for portfolio approach
- Balance debt, speculation, and extreme investments

### Warning Signs to Watch
- **Food shortages**: Immediate population loss and mood drops
- **High debt (>500)**: Interest rates increase, economic pressure builds
- **Low population mood (<30)**: Productivity drops, instability increases
- **Economic bust cycles**: All investments become more expensive
- **Resource chain disruption**: Natural disasters can break production chains

### Victory Conditions
The game rewards multiple victory paths:
- **Economic Dominance**: Achieve massive resource generation through smart combinations
- **Technological Supremacy**: Unlock advanced eras through research mastery
- **Population Prosperity**: Maintain high mood and steady growth
- **Crisis Management**: Survive and thrive through disasters and economic cycles

### Advanced Tips
1. **Timing is Everything**: Economic cycles affect all prices - buy during busts, sell during booms
2. **Diversification**: Don't put all resources into one strategy
3. **Population Balance**: More people = more consumption, plan food production carefully
4. **Infrastructure First**: Basic systems enable exponential scaling later
5. **Crisis Preparation**: Always maintain emergency food and resource reserves
