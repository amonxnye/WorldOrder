# World Order - Multiplayer Development Documentation

## Overview

This document details the comprehensive multiplayer functionality that has been implemented in the World Order game, transforming it from a single-player nation-building simulator into a fully-featured multiplayer strategy game with real-time synchronization, turn-based mechanics, and advanced diplomatic features.

## Project Context

**World Order** is a historical nation-building strategy game built with:
- **Frontend**: React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: Zustand
- **3D Visualization**: Three.js, Babylon.js
- **Backend**: Firebase (Authentication, Firestore, Hosting)
- **Build Tool**: Vite

Players lead their chosen nation from 1925 to the present day, managing resources, researching technologies, building economies, and establishing diplomatic relations.

## Multiplayer Architecture Implementation

### 1. Enhanced Zustand Store Structure

The core game state has been expanded with a comprehensive multiplayer system:

#### New Interfaces Added

```typescript
interface GameEvent {
  id: string;
  type: 'trade_offer' | 'war_declared' | 'attack_launched' | 'tech_researched' | 'turn_ended';
  fromUserId?: string;
  targetUserId?: string;
  data: any;
  timestamp: number;
  read: boolean;
}

interface TurnInfo {
  currentPlayer: string;
  turnNumber: number;
  deadline?: number; // Optional turn time limit
  actionsTaken: string[]; // Track what actions were taken this turn
}

interface MultiplayerState {
  isMultiplayer: boolean;
  isHost: boolean;
  players: Record<string, {
    userId: string;
    nationName: string;
    leaderName: string;
    isOnline: boolean;
    lastSeen: number;
  }>;
  turnInfo: TurnInfo;
  gameEvents: GameEvent[];
  pendingActions: any[]; // Actions waiting to be synchronized
  syncStatus: 'synced' | 'syncing' | 'error';
}
```

#### Enhanced GameState Interface

The main `GameState` interface now includes:
- Complete multiplayer state management
- Real-time synchronization controls
- Turn-based mechanics
- Event handling system
- Action queuing for network reliability

### 2. Multiplayer Actions & Functions

### 7. Turn-Based Mechanics

#### Turn Management System

**Turn Flow:**
1. **Turn Start**: Player becomes active, can perform actions
2. **Action Phase**: Player can research tech, invest resources, manage population
3. **Turn End**: Player clicks "End Turn", advances to next player
4. **Round Completion**: When all players finish, new round begins

**Turn Restrictions:**
- Only current player can perform game-changing actions
- Other players can view state but cannot modify
- Turn timer can be implemented for competitive play
- Actions are logged and visible to all players

**Action Tracking:**
- Each action taken during turn is logged
- Other players see real-time action summaries
- Turn history maintained for game review

### 8. Event System Architecture

#### Event Categories

**High Priority Events:**
- Trade offers (require immediate attention)
- War declarations (major game state changes)
- Direct attacks (combat resolution)

**Medium Priority Events:**
- Diplomatic stance changes
- Alliance formations/dissolutions

**Low Priority Events:**
- Technology research completions
- Turn completions
- Resource milestones

#### Event Processing

**Real-time Flow:**
1. Action occurs in one player's game
2. Event is created and stored in Firebase
3. Real-time listeners trigger in other players' clients
4. Event is added to local event feed
5. Notification appears with appropriate priority
6. User can interact with actionable events

### 9. State Synchronization Strategy

#### Conflict Resolution

**Strategy:** Last-write-wins with client-side validation
- Firebase atomic updates prevent corruption
- Client optimistic updates with server reconciliation
- Queued actions retry on network failure

**Synchronization Points:**
- **Immediate**: Diplomatic actions, trade offers, attacks
- **Periodic**: Resource states, population changes
- **Turn-based**: Major game state advancement

#### Data Consistency

**Approaches Implemented:**
- **Incremental updates** for resource changes
- **Full state sync** on player join/reconnect
- **Event sourcing** for action history
- **Presence heartbeat** for connection monitoring
